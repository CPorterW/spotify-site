                <h1>Folk</h1>
                <p>
                    Artists include<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2RQXRUsr4IW1f3mKyKsy4B?si=L-wJt-ZVTQeGcRKrRvJ1CQ">Noah Kahan,</a>Ritt Momney, Hozier and more. 
                    Tones go from pensive and wistful to brightly sarcastic. 
                    If you want thought-provoking lyrics or soothing melodies, this is the playlist for you. 
                    This playlist has some of the most popular folk music from popular artists. 
                    There's a lot of excellent storytelling in this playlist, from Mute by Radical Face to Cleopatra by the Lumineers. 
                    Like all playlists I can't resist injecting a little romance with Ohio Forever by Michigander, Romeo and Juliet by Peter McPoland and Born to Die by JJ Wilde. 
                    Folk-lovers will be all here for Hotel Walls by Smith and Thell, Rivers and Roads by The Head and the Heart, and Sleep on the Floor by the Lumineers. 
                    Matt Maeson, Josiah and the Bonnevilles, gavn!, Yoke Lore, and Wrabel are big names in my book, too. 
                </p>

                    His lyrics can be wistful or self-deprecating, but the tone of his music is always hopeful.
                    Many of my playlists are chock-ful of the clean versions of his songs.

                    Born to Die and Colors by JJ Wilde and Billy Raffoul are romantic, soothing songs that blend rock and folk in the best way.
                    This is the sound of commitment at last.
