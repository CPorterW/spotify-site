      <p>
        Welcome to Spirit of Spotify! 
        I'm a music lover and a Christian and I thought it would be useful to share some clean music.
        I've divided my music by genre, and by levels of un-child friendly content. 
        None of my music is explicit, which means the F and S words, and graphically sexual content, never appear.
        I will warn you if any lesser swear words, sexual content, or drug references appear.
        Entire playlists here could be played at your church or elementary school.
        You should know in advance that I won't be sharing music that you've heard before. 
        Also, there won't be much country. It's easy to find clean country by yourself! But I recommend Walker Hayes and Jordan Davis.
      </p>

      <h3>Underground Pop - My Favorite Genre</h3>
      <p>
        Artists include, Blake Rose, Dempsey Hope, Joe P, Alexander 23 and many, many more.
        Tones shift from optimistic love songs all the way to emo. Don't worry, I'll warn you!
        If your looking for extraordinary, hopeful, uplifting music, you've come to the right place.
        I have a taste for the bizarre and comical, too, so look out for that in songs like Off My Mind, by Joe P. and Girl by Alexander 23, two of my favorites.
        If you want sweet and romantic, start with Kassidy by Dempsey Hope and She Likes It by Russel Dickerson.
        Gracie Abrams, Alt Bloom, The Band Camino, Ben Kessler and Corey Harper definitely deserve your attention as well.

      </ul>
      <h3>Folk</h3>
      <p>
        Artists include Noah Kahan, Ritt Momney, Hozier and more.
        Tones go from pensive and wistful to brightly sarcastic.
        If you want thought-provoking lyrics or soothing melodies, this is the playlist for you.
        This playlist has some of the most popular folk music from popular artists.
        There's a lot of excellent storytelling in this playlist, from Mute by Radical Face to Cleopatra by the Lumineers.
        Like all playlists I can't resist injecting a little romance with Ohio Forever by Michigander, Romeo and Juliet by Peter McPoland and Born to Die by JJ Wilde.
        Folk-lovers will be all here for Hotel Walls by Smith and Thell, Rivers and Roads by The Head and the Heart, and Sleep on the Floor by the Lumineers.
        Matt Maeson, Josiah and the Bonnevilles, gavn!, Yoke Lore, and Wrabel are big names in my book, too.

      </ul>
      <h3>Electronic/Danceable Music</h3>
      <p>
        Artists include Wingtip, Jake Scott, Baynk and more.
        Even my EDM is very lyric-focused. There's a range from upbeat pop to club beats.
        If you're looking for high-energy songs to get a party moving, here is the place to look!
        Wingtip and Zachary Knowles come out swinging with Hope Somebody Loves You and Eyes Closed, respectively.
        High-energy rhythmic artists make a good show too, from Splat by Connor Price to Champagne for Two by Devin Kennedy.
        Keep an eye on Taska Black, Mykyl, and ford., if loud electric music is your jam.
        I didn't add Sylvan Esso to the list for a few reasons, but depending on your taste, she may also be worth a listen.

      </ul>
      <h3>Rhythmic/Urban Music</h3>
      <p>
        Artists include Zachary Knowles, Joseph Tilley, Connor Price and more.
        This isn't a playlist that rap/hip-hop aficionados are gonna adore. 
        Clean music and rhythmic music don't go together super often, so this playlist is pretty cheesy, with the likes of Nic D and Connor Price.
        That doesn't mean there aren't some bangers. R&B lovers will appreciate 'here' by Emily Vaughn.
        Carpool by Zachary Knowles, Backseat by Jutes, and pretty much any song by Joseph Tilley are hip-hop enough for most.

      </ul>
